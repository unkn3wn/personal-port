          Ol√°! I am a recent graduate from San Jose State University Tech
          Bootcamp, Powered by FullStack Academy, seeking to land my first job.
          I love to learn new things especially if it is tech related. How did I
          get into coding? When I was in seventh grade I remember we would go to
          the computer lab probably once a week and, if we were lucky, we would
          go twice a week. When I was searching the web, I right clicked and a
          few options came up. I saw the word inspect, clicked on it, and long
          lines of random code popped up. At the time, I had known code as
          "random letters and words". My last year of high school was when I
          started to learn more about code. I took the Intro to Computer Science
          course where I learned about HTML, CSS, and some Javascript on
          Code.org.Two years later,I decided to do a Bootcamp to learn about web
          development, and here I am today, coding my own portfolio, to land my
          first job and continue expanding my knowledge of code.
