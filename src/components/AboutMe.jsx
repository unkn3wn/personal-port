          ol√° I am recent graduate from San Jose State University Tech Bootcamp
          Powered by FullStack Academy seeking to land my first job. I Love to
          learn new things especially if its tech related. How I got into
          coding? When I was in seventh grade I remeber we would go to computer
          lab probably 1 time a week and if we were lucky we would go twice a
          week. I was searching the web and I right clicked and a few options
          came up. I saw the word inspect and I clicked on it and a bunch of
          random code had popped up. At the time I had known code as "random
          letters and words". My last year of high school was when I really
          started to learn more about code I took the intro to computer science
          course where I learned about HTML, CSS, and a little bit of javascript
          on code.org. Despite loving code I went in with the idea of wanting to
          major in Cyber Secrity but that didnt go as planned so thats when I
          decided to do a Bootcamp to learn about web development, and here I am
          today coding my own portfolio in hopes of landing my first job to
          continue expanding on my knowledge of code.
